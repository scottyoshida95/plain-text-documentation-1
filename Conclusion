The concept of Interchangable Parts is one of the best ideas that mankind has everhad. 
Without it, manufaturing would be slow and inconsistent.
More critically, repairs would take a very long time 
as each broken part would have to be specially re-manufactured for the 
single broken product at hand. 
Without Interchangable Parts, engineering would be much more difficult 
(if not impossible) as there would be no consistency or convention
between different pockets of engineers.
